# infix-to-postfix-
"""
Project: Infix to Postfix Converter

Description:
This project implements the Shunting-yard algorithm to convert an infix expression to a postfix expression. The algorithm uses a stack to manage operator precedence and parentheses while ensuring the correct order of operations.

The program processes an input infix expression consisting of operands (letters or numbers) and operators (+, -, *, /, ^). It correctly handles parentheses to dictate operator precedence. The output is the corresponding postfix expression, which is suitable for evaluation using stack-based methods.

Features:
- Supports basic arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, and ^
- Handles operator precedence and associativity
- Processes expressions with parentheses
- Outputs a valid postfix expression
